      services to draw administrative procedures in a collaborative way using a
      particular diagrammatic graphical notation.


      Common users can search and browse the diagram and the informations
      included in it.


      When authenticated, common users can post feedbacks on each diagram
      element in order to report issues or improvement suggestions.


      Three roles other than common users can collaborate in the diagram
      production:


      1. the **procedure owner** leads the drawing process and is accountable
      for the publication of the diagram;

      2. the **procedure reviewer** is accountable for the technical correctness
      of the diagram;

      3. the **procedure editor** is the one that draws the diagram according to
      the reviewer's directions.
